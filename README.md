dota2_hero
==========

A Python module to read the list of heroes in Dota 2 from Valve's website. Does not require an API key.

Run the python file with "--help" for usage as a script, or run pydoc dota2_hero for module documentation.
The source is only 300 lines, so you can always read that as a guide.
